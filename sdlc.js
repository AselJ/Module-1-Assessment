/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The analysis of requirements in the SDLC involves gathering, documenting, and validating stakeholder needs to ensure a clear understanding and successful development of the software system."

const design = "Design in the SDLC involves creating a conceptual and detailed plan that outlines the structure, components, and functionality of the software system to be developed."

const implementation = "Implementation in the SDLC refers to the stage where the software system is developed according to the defined requirements and design specifications, including coding, testing, and integrating different components to create a functional product."

const testingAndIntegration = "Testing and Integration in the SDLC is the phase where the developed software system is thoroughly tested to ensure its functionality, reliability, and compatibility, and different components are combined and validated to ensure proper integration and smooth operation of the system as a whole."

const maintain = "Maintenance in the SDLC refers to the ongoing activities performed after the software system has been deployed, including bug fixes, enhancements, performance optimizations, and addressing user feedback, to ensure the system remains functional, secure, and aligned with changing business requirements throughout its lifecycle."
